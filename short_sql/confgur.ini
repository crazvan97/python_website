"How would you test a login page?"

✅ Comprehensive Answer: How Would You Test a Login Page?
1. Understand the Requirements (Requirement-Based Testing)

Start by reviewing the requirements or specifications:
What are the valid username/password combinations?
Are there any password rules (min length, special characters)?
What is the expected behavior for invalid input?
Is multi-factor authentication (MFA) involved?
Are there any security/time-out rules?

2. Test Case Design (Based on ISTQB Principles)

🔹 Positive Test Cases (Happy Path):
Correct username and correct password → should log in successfully.
Case where user already logged in → should redirect or block duplicate sessions.

🔹 Negative Test Cases:
Correct username and wrong password.
Wrong username and correct password.
Empty username and/or password fields.
SQL injection attempt in either field (security testing).
Input with special characters or whitespace only.
Password field is masked (UI/UX testing).

3. Boundary Value & Equivalence Partitioning (Black Box Techniques)

Test min/max length of username/password (e.g., 8–20 characters).
Input exactly at the boundary (e.g., 8, 20 chars), just below, and just above.
Valid and invalid equivalence classes (e.g., valid email vs malformed email).

4. UI & Usability Testing:

Check alignment, readability, and accessibility.
Tab order works correctly (keyboard navigation).
Error messages are clear and accurate.
Focus returns to first field on error.

5. Functional Testing:

Clicking the login button behaves the same as pressing Enter.
"Remember Me" functionality works as expected.
"Forgot Password" and "Sign Up" links navigate correctly.
Error messages don’t expose system details.

6. Security Testing:

Brute-force protection (e.g., lockout after 5 attempts).
Secure transmission (HTTPS, SSL).
Password is never shown in plain text or URL.
CAPTCHA or MFA behavior (if applicable).
Session management – user logs out, cannot go back using browser back.

7. Compatibility & Cross-Browser Testing:

Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Keyboard-only and screen-reader accessibility.

8. Performance Testing (Optional but Valuable):

Page load time.
Login delay under load (e.g., many simultaneous users).

9. API Testing (If login is backend-driven via API):

Check the response for login request (200 OK, 401 Unauthorized).
Validate token or session ID returned.
Verify that token expires after logout.

10. Test Data Considerations:

Use valid credentials for real users.
Test accounts with different roles (admin, user, guest).
Expired or locked accounts.

🧠 Bonus: Apply ISTQB Principles
Use Traceability to link test cases to requirements.
Apply Risk-Based Testing – prioritize security tests due to higher impact.
Ensure Test Coverage – functional, boundary, security, and UX.
Maintain a Test Log & Report – for reproducibility and tracking.







✅ What Does "End-to-End Testing" Mean?
End-to-end (E2E) testing is a type of testing where you validate a complete user flow from start to finish,
across the entire system — including frontend, backend, database, APIs, and third-party integrations.

🔍 In Simple Terms:
"End-to-end testing simulates a real user interacting with the system and verifies that the system works as expected from the user’s point of view."

🧪 Example for a Login Page:
In an end-to-end test for a login feature, you would:
Open the login page in a real browser.
Enter valid username and password.
Submit the form.
If MFA is enabled, enter a valid OTP.
Verify that the user is redirected to their dashboard.
Check that the user session is created (e.g., cookies or tokens).
Log out and ensure the session ends correctly.

🔁 E2E Test Includes:
UI/UX layer (e.g., clicking buttons, typing input)
Application logic (e.g., authentication rules)
External services (e.g., OTP or email providers)
Persistence (e.g., database entries for login history or tokens)

🎯 Why It Matters:
Ensures all components integrate properly.
Catches issues that unit or integration tests might miss.
Confirms that user workflows behave correctly in real-world scenarios.

⚠️ Tradeoffs:
E2E tests are slower and more fragile than unit tests.
They require real environments or well-mocked services.
Automation of E2E (e.g., with Cypress, Selenium, Playwright) is powerful but complex.








✅ Examples of Security and Timeout Rules in Login Testing
🔐 1. Account Lockout after Failed Attempts
Rule: After 5 failed login attempts, the account is locked for 15 minutes.
Test: Enter wrong password 5 times → system locks the account and shows an appropriate error.
Security Purpose: Prevent brute-force attacks.

⏳ 2. Session Timeout
Rule: After 10 minutes of inactivity, the user is logged out automatically.
Test: Login → stay idle → verify logout after 10 minutes.
Security Purpose: Prevent unauthorized access from unattended sessions.

🔐 3. Password Expiry
Rule: User must change their password every 90 days.
Test: Login with a password older than 90 days → user is prompted to reset password.
Security Purpose: Prevent long-term credential exposure.

🛑 4. Concurrent Login Restrictions
Rule: Only one active session per user is allowed.
Test: Login from one browser → login again from another → first session ends or is denied.
Security Purpose: Prevent session hijacking.

📱 5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Expiry
Rule: OTP must be used within 60 seconds.
Test: Wait more than 60 seconds after generating OTP → verify it fails.
Security Purpose: Avoid OTP reuse or theft.

🕵️ 6. Auto-Logout on Browser Close
Rule: User is logged out automatically when the browser closes (if “remember me” is not selected).
Test: Login → close browser → reopen → should prompt login again.
Security Purpose: Prevent session persistence in shared environments.

⚠️ 7. Error Message Obfuscation
Rule: Error messages should not reveal whether the username or password is incorrect.
Test: Enter invalid username → error says "Invalid credentials" instead of "User not found".
Security Purpose: Prevent user enumeration.





✅ UI Checklist for Login Page
🖼️ 1. Visual Layout & Alignment
All fields (username, password) are properly aligned.
Labels are clear and near the corresponding inputs.
Buttons are consistently styled and not overlapping.
The logo and brand elements are placed correctly.

🔤 2. Field Labels & Placeholder Text
Labels are visible and descriptive (e.g., “Email”, not just “Username”).
Placeholder text is helpful and disappears on typing.
Placeholder and label are not conflicting.

🔍 3. Input Behavior
Username/email and password fields accept proper input types.
Password is masked by default (type="password").
Typing in fields updates input instantly with no delay.
Cursor focus moves logically with the Tab key (keyboard navigation).
Autofill works as expected (if allowed).

👁️ 4. Show/Hide Password Functionality
Clicking “👁️ Show Password” reveals the text.
Clicking again hides it.
Functionality works on both desktop and mobile.

🧠 5. Validation & Error Handling
Leaving fields empty shows correct validation messages.
Invalid email format shows a warning (e.g., “Please enter a valid email”).
Error messages appear next to the relevant field.
Errors are styled (e.g., red border or icon).
On error, focus returns to the field with a problem.

🕹️ 6. Button Behavior
Login button is disabled until required fields are filled (if applicable).
Clicking the button or pressing Enter does the same action.
There is a loading state (spinner) on login attempt.
Button is not clickable multiple times during login.

🔗 7. Link Behavior
“Forgot Password”, “Create Account”, and “Help” links work.
Links open in the correct context (e.g., new tab or same page).
Links have hover effects (underline or color change).

♿ 8. Accessibility Checks
Fields and buttons have accessible aria-labels or visible labels.
Can navigate the entire form using keyboard only.
Sufficient contrast between text and background.
Screen readers announce input fields and errors properly.

📱 9. Responsive Design
Page looks correct and usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
Fields don’t overflow on small screens.
Keyboard doesn’t cover input fields on mobile devices.

🌐 10. Language & Feedback
Error and success messages are grammatically correct.
Messages are localized if the app supports multiple languages.




What Are Non-Functional Test Cases?
Non-functional test cases verify how the system performs under certain conditions rather than whether it works correctly (which is what functional testing covers). They focus on the quality attributes of a system.

Examples of non-functional test cases:
"Verify that the system responds to user input within 2 seconds under normal load."
"Test system performance under 1,000 concurrent users."
"Check if the application supports 5 different languages correctly."
"Ensure the system can recover within 10 seconds after a crash."


Performance Testing -> Measures response time, throughput, and resource usage.
Load Testing -> Checks system behavior under expected user load.
Stress Testing -> Tests system behavior under extreme conditions.
Scalability Testing -> Evaluates how well the system scales with increased load.
Security Testing -> Ensures the system is secure from vulnerabilities and threats.
Usability Testing -> Checks how user-friendly and intuitive the interface is.
Compatibility Testing -> Ensures the system works across different devices, OS, and browsers.
Reliability Testing -> Tests how consistently the system performs over time.
Maintainability Testing -> Measures how easy it is to maintain or update the system.
Recoverability Testing -> Checks how well the system recovers from crashes or failures.
Internationalization/Localization -> Verifies language, date, currency, etc., work for different regions.
