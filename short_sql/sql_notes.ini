When you specify GROUP BY continent the result is that you get only one row for each different value of continent.

The WHERE clause filters rows before the aggregation, the HAVING clause filters after the aggregation.

ORDER BY permits us to see the result of a SELECT in any particular order.
We may indicate ASC or DESC for ascending (smallest first, largest last) or descending order
